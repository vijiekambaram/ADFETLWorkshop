# ADF ELT Pipeline hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to building pipeline using ADF, how to use parameters/variables, how to copy the data from various data sources and load into sink, how to send email notification.

By the end of the lab, you will be able to build an end-to-end pipeline.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the logic you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription with permission to create resources.

2. Follow all the steps provided in [Before the Hands-on Lab](Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20ADF%20ETL%20Pipeline.md).

## Exercise 1: Azure Data Factory - Set Up Integration Run Time

1. Go to Azure Data Factory resource created in Before HOL and Click on Author & Monitor.

2. From ADF home page, click on Pencil icon.

3. In order to connect to private network which is not accessible by outside world, we need to have Self Hosted Integration run time. Here we will see how to connect to local folder using Self Hosted IR.

a.	Click on Connections at the bottom.

## Exercise 2: Azure Data Factory - Linked Services for Local Folder

This exercise is to create connections to connect to Local folder.

1.	Create Linked Service to connect to Local Folder.

2.	Click on Connections -> Linked Services -> New.

3.	Click on File and select File System.

3. 


## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete resource group

1. Using the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting **Resource groups** in the menu.

2. Search for the name of your research group and select it from the list.

3. Select **Delete** in the command bar and confirm the deletion by re-typing the Resource group name and selecting **Delete**.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
